I've always wanted to have a blog. 

I even started one a few years ago but it took too much time to write articles. 

I make many many things (actually.... too many) and I never find time to write about them.

I'm an electronic engineer but in the years I developed a lot of different passions: 
- Digital electronics (mainly firmware programming)
- Informatics
- Domotics (I'm a huge fan of [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io))
- Woodworking
- Building things in general, from small wooden gadgets to wooden houses for kids

A few days ago I've seen this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnE7c0ELEH8) from NetworkChuck and it gave me a new boost. It's both simple and complicated enough for me!!!

First try, I already get an error.... I would have wanted to use this beatiful Theme, [Blowfish](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/blowfish/) but it gives me some incompatibility issues... I'll try again later!!

For now I'll just use [Poison](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/poison/) as theme:
